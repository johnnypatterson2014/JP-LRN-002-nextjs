## Example Next.js App 

Typescript
 - TypeScript is a way of writing JavaScript a bit more structured than pure JavaScript. This variant is used in many modern web applications and has been adopted by LangChain and LlamaIndex for their JavaScript versions.

NextJS
 - is a React framework that makes it easier to create a web based UI
 - it is simplified and optimized to create web applications (frontend UI)
 - Next.js handles the tooling and configuration needed for React, and provides additional structure, features, and optimizations for your application.

Vercel
 - Vercel is a hosting service created by the creators of Next.js and specially designed to host applications of this framework
 - vercel is designed to automatically deploy your nextjs app whenever you push changes to your git repo
